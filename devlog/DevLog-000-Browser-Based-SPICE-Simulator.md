# DevLog-000: Browser-Based SPICE Circuit Simulator

Date: 2026-01-31

## Problem Statement

LTSpice is an excellent circuit simulator with a minimal, fast GUI. However, it is:
- Desktop-only (Windows native, Mac port available)
- Closed source (cannot be ported to web)
- Not shareable (circuits require LTSpice installation to view)

Goal: Investigate feasibility of a browser-based SPICE simulator with a minimal GUI similar to LTSpice.

## Research Summary

### LTSpice vs NGSpice

| Feature | LTSpice | NGSpice |
|---------|---------|---------|
| License | Proprietary freeware | Open source (BSD) |
| GUI | Built-in, excellent | Command-line (separate GUIs available) |
| Platform | Windows/Mac | Cross-platform |
| Speed | Very fast | Moderate |
| Web Portable | No | Yes (via WebAssembly) |

NGSpice is the only viable option for browser-based simulation due to its open source license.

### Existing Browser-Based Solutions

1. EasyEDA - Full-featured but bloated, not minimal
2. CircuitLab - Freemium, not open source
3. Falstad - Real-time but not SPICE-based
4. EEcircuit - NGSpice WASM, text-only input (no schematic GUI)

None of these provide a minimal LTSpice-like experience.

### EEcircuit Architecture Analysis

EEcircuit (https://github.com/eelab-dev/EEcircuit) demonstrates that NGSpice can run entirely client-side:

Architecture:
- NGSpice compiled to WebAssembly via Emscripten
- Published as npm package: eecircuit-engine
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Chakra-UI
- Editor: Monaco (VS Code editor)
- Plotting: WebGL-Plot
- Web Workers: Comlink for async simulation
- Deployment: Static hosting (Vercel)

Key finding: No backend required. All simulation runs in browser.

## Technical Feasibility

### Confirmed Possible

1. NGSpice WASM compilation - Already done by EEcircuit team
2. Client-side simulation - Proven to work
3. Web Workers for non-blocking UI - Implemented via Comlink
4. WebGL plotting - Fast enough for real-time visualization

### Challenges

1. Schematic Editor - EEcircuit only has text input, no graphical schematic capture
2. File Size - NGSpice WASM is 2-5 MB, acceptable for modern web
3. Performance - WASM is slower than native, but adequate for most circuits

## High-Level Proposal

### Option A: Minimal GUI on Top of EEcircuit Engine

Use the existing eecircuit-engine npm package and build a minimal schematic editor.

Stack:
- Simulator: eecircuit-engine (NGSpice WASM)
- Frontend: Vanilla JS or Svelte (no React bloat)
- Editor: CodeMirror (lighter than Monaco) or custom textarea
- Schematic: HTML5 Canvas with minimal component library
- Plotting: WebGL-Plot or custom Canvas
- Build: Vite

Estimated effort: 2-4 weeks

### Option B: Full Custom Build

Compile NGSpice to WASM ourselves for full control over the build.

Additional work:
- Set up Emscripten toolchain
- Configure NGSpice build for WASM target
- Create JavaScript bindings
- Handle file system emulation for model files

Estimated effort: 4-6 weeks

### Recommended Approach

Start with Option A. Use eecircuit-engine to validate the concept, then consider Option B if customization is needed.

## Minimal Schematic Editor Requirements

To match LTSpice experience:

1. Component palette (R, L, C, V, I, diodes, transistors)
2. Wire drawing tool
3. Component rotation/mirroring
4. Node labeling
5. Netlist generation from schematic
6. Simulation control (.tran, .ac, .dc, .op)
7. Waveform viewer with zoom/pan

## File Size Estimates

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| NGSpice WASM | 2-5 MB |
| Minimal JS framework | 50 KB |
| Schematic editor | 100-200 KB |
| Plotting library | 50-100 KB |
| Total | 2.5-5.5 MB |

Acceptable for modern web applications.

## Next Steps

1. Clone EEcircuit and run locally to understand the codebase
2. Extract eecircuit-engine usage patterns
3. Prototype minimal schematic editor with Canvas API
4. Integrate netlist generation
5. Connect to simulation engine
6. Build waveform viewer

## MVP Scope Decisions (2026-01-31)

### Stack

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | SvelteKit | Minimal, performant, reactive |
| Package Manager | pnpm | Fast, disk-efficient |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast HMR, native ESM |
| Simulator | eecircuit-engine | NGSpice WASM, proven to work |
| Plotting | WebGL-Plot or custom Canvas | High performance, independent X/Y zoom |
| Editor | CodeMirror 6 | Lighter than Monaco, extensible |
| Styling | Vanilla CSS | Minimal footprint, LTSpice dark theme |

### UI Style Guidelines

**Sharp Corners Only**: All UI elements must have sharp corners (border-radius: 0) to match LTSpice's clean, technical aesthetic. This applies to:
- Tooltips
- Indicators (zoom mode, etc.)
- Legends
- Buttons
- Panels
- All other UI elements

No rounded corners anywhere in the application.

### Component Library

**MVP (No Import)**:
- Passives: R, L, C
- Sources: V (DC, AC, PULSE, SINE), I, GND
- Semiconductors: Diode, BJT (NPN/PNP), MOSFET (N/P)
- Use bundled models from eecircuit-engine (BSIM4, PTM, FreePDK45)

**Future**: Support user `.lib`/`.model` file import via virtual filesystem (Emscripten FS API, same approach as EEcircuit)

### Simulation Types

All simulation types are supported by NGSpice and passed through as netlist commands:

| Analysis | Command | MVP |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Transient | `.tran` | Yes |
| AC | `.ac` | Yes |
| DC Sweep | `.dc` | Yes |
| Operating Point | `.op` | Yes |
| Noise | `.noise` | Yes |
| Transfer Function | `.tf` | Yes |
| Parameter Sweep | `.step` | Yes |
| Measurement | `.meas` | Yes |

The frontend generates netlists; NGSpice handles all analysis types natively.

### File Format

**MVP**: LTSpice `.asc` file import/export

The `.asc` format is plain text with the following structure:
```
Version 4
SHEET 1 880 680
WIRE x1 y1 x2 y2
SYMBOL res x y R0
SYMATTR InstName R1
SYMATTR Value 1k
TEXT x y Left 2 !.tran 1m
```

Key elements:
- `WIRE x1 y1 x2 y2` - Wire segments
- `SYMBOL type x y rotation` - Component placement
- `SYMATTR` - Component attributes (name, value)
- `TEXT` with `!` prefix - SPICE directives

### Persistence

**MVP**: localStorage only
- Auto-save current schematic
- Named circuit slots
- No cloud, no URL sharing

### Waveform Viewer Features

| Feature | MVP | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Multiple traces | Yes | Color-coded |
| Zoom/Pan | Yes | Better than LTSpice |
| Independent X/Y zoom | Yes | Plotly-style controls |
| Cursors | Yes | Two cursors with delta readout |
| FFT view | Yes | For AC analysis |
| CSV export | Yes | Download button |
| Log scale | Yes | For frequency plots |

### Platform

**MVP**: Desktop only (1024px+ width)
**Future**: Mobile with component panel drawer

### Offline Support

**MVP**: Online only
**Future**: PWA with service worker

### Phase 7: Netlist Generation - Complete (2026-02-01)
Implemented connectivity analysis and SPICE netlist generation from schematic:

#### Netlist Module (`src/lib/netlist/`)
- `types.ts` - Type definitions for nets, pin connections, SPICE components
  - `COMPONENT_PREFIX` mapping: component type to SPICE prefix (resistor->R, inductor->L, etc.)
  - `PIN_ORDER` mapping: correct pin ordering for each component type
- `connectivity.ts` - Wire connectivity analysis using Union-Find algorithm
  - Groups connected wire segments and component pins into nets
  - Assigns node numbers (0 for ground, 1+ for other nodes)
  - Detects floating pins and unconnected components
- `netlist-generator.ts` - Converts schematic to SPICE netlist text
  - `generateNetlist()` - Main function returning structured netlist
  - `componentToSpice()` - Converts component to SPICE line with correct pin order
  - `netlistToText()` - Formats as SPICE text
  - `schematicToNetlist()` - Convenience wrapper
  - `generateNodeLabels()` - Creates node labels for display on schematic

#### UI Integration
- "Generate Netlist (Ctrl+N)" button in toolbar
- Populates netlist editor with generated SPICE code
- Status bar shows component/wire/node counts

### Phase 7.5: Node Labels and Probes - WIP (2026-02-01)
Added node label display and probe mode for voltage/current measurement:

#### Node Labels
- Node numbers displayed on schematic after netlist generation
- Green background for ground (node 0), blue for other nodes
- Labels positioned at first point of each net

#### Probe Mode (P key)
- Press P to enter probe mode
- Voltage probe: Click on wire to probe V(node)
- Current probe: Click on component to probe I(component)
- Differential voltage: Click and hold on first node (red + probe), drag to second node (black - probe)
- Probe icons: Pointed probe shape for voltage, current clamp shape for current
- Probes follow cursor position

#### Probe Integration (Debug WIP)
- `onprobe` callback prop on SchematicCanvas
- Probe events dispatched to parent component
- Probes stored in array, can be toggled on/off
- Waveform filtering by active probes (partial implementation)
- Known issues: Probe-to-trace matching needs refinement

### Phase 8: Waveform Viewer Enhancements (2026-02-01)

#### Plotly-Style Zoom Behavior
- Default left-click drag now performs directional zoom:
  - Horizontal drag (ratio > 3:1): X-only zoom with full-height selection band
  - Vertical drag (ratio < 1:3): Y-only zoom with full-width selection band
  - Diagonal drag (ratio between 1:3 and 3:1): Box zoom with rectangle selection
- Pan moved to middle-click (scroll wheel click + drag)
- Visual feedback: Dashed white outline with semi-transparent fill, mode indicator
- Minimum 10 pixel drag required before zoom type is determined

#### Tabbed Waveform Panels
- Multiple waveform panels as tabs
- Add (+) button to create new tabs
- Close (x) button on each tab (at least one tab always exists)
- Active tab highlighting
- Probes add traces to the active tab instead of replacing all traces

#### Delete Mode in Waveform (Key 5)
- Toggle delete mode with key 5
- Delete indicator shows instructions
- Click on trace names in legend to remove traces
- Escape exits delete mode

### Probe System Improvements (2026-02-01)

#### Fixed Probe-to-Trace Matching
- Refactored `addProbeTracesToActiveTab()` to only add traces for a specific probe
- Each probe click now adds only that specific trace to the active tab
- Traces are not duplicated if already present in the active tab
- Removed auto-trace generation on simulation run

#### Improved Wire-to-Node Detection
- Voltage probes now work anywhere on wires connected to a node, not just near node labels
- Implemented BFS traversal through wire connectivity:
  - Follows wire endpoints that touch each other
  - Follows through junctions (explicit T-connections)
  - Checks if junctions lie on wire segments
- Uses pre-built lookup structures for efficiency:
  - `endpointToWires`: Maps point keys to wires with that endpoint (O(1) lookup)
  - `pointToNode`: Maps node label positions to node names (O(1) lookup)
- Returns immediately when a node label is found (early exit)

#### Current Probe Handling
- Click on component to create current probe
- Uses `targetComponent` in probe state to track component clicks separately from wire clicks
- Works for all components (V, I, L, R, C, D, Q, M)

#### Client-Side Current Calculation (Fixed 2026-02-01)
NGSpice only outputs currents for voltage sources and inductors by default. The eecircuit-engine WASM build doesn't support `.save` directives, so we calculate currents client-side from node voltages:

**Implementation** (`src/lib/netlist/current-calculator.ts`):
- `parseValue()` - Parses component values with SI prefixes (1k, 1u, 1n, etc.)
- `calculateComponentCurrent()` - Computes current for a single component
- `calculateMissingCurrents()` - Batch calculates all missing currents

**Formulas used**:
- Resistor: `I = (V1 - V2) / R` (Ohm's law)
- Capacitor: `I = C * d(V1 - V2)/dt` (numerical derivative)

**Performance**: Negligible overhead - just array math on existing voltage data.

#### Differential Voltage Probe Fix (2026-02-01)
Fixed bug where differential voltage probe was adding two separate traces instead of one.

**Problem**: `dataMatchesProbe()` was returning true for both V(node1) and V(node2), causing two traces to be added.

**Solution**:
- Removed voltage-diff handling from `dataMatchesProbe()`
- Added dedicated handling in `addProbeTracesToActiveTab()`:
  - Fetches V(node1) and V(node2) data from simulation results
  - Computes difference: `diffValues = V(node1) - V(node2)`
  - Adds single trace named `V(node1,node2)`

**Usage**: In probe mode (P), click and drag from one node to another to create differential probe.

#### Known Issues (Still WIP)
- Voltage probe detection may still fail in some edge cases with complex wire networks
- Diode/transistor currents cannot be calculated client-side (nonlinear)

### Phase 10: Persistence - Partial (2026-02-01)
Implemented schematic save/load to JSON files:

#### Save Schematic (Ctrl+S)
- Exports schematic as JSON file with timestamp filename
- Includes: components, wires, junctions, netlist text
- Format version for future compatibility

#### Open Schematic (Ctrl+O)
- File dialog to select .json file
- Restores components, wires, junctions
- Restores netlist if saved
- Clears existing probes

#### JSON Format
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "schematic": {
    "components": [...],
    "wires": [...],
    "junctions": [...]
  },
  "netlist": "* SPICE netlist...",
  "savedAt": "2026-02-01T..."
}
```

### Not Started
